### Project Goals
The aims of this project are:
1)	To develop automated bioinformatic pipelines for detection of differential methylation analysis in mitochondrial DNA
2)	To implement these pipelines in order to uncover potential biomarkers that can predict cervical cancer progression based on the methylation profile of mitochondrial DNA.

### Methodology
*	Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) data from patients with precancer lesions and known disease
outcomes will be mapped against the reference human genome in order to detect both CpG and non-CpG (CpH)
methylation.
*	Methylation levels between patients that developed an advanced disease stage (CIN2, CIN3+) and controls (remission
of disease) will be compared in order to detect statistically significant differentially methylated sites in mtDNA and
deduce causal relationships.
*	For the abovementioned steps, analytical algorithms will be developed in R, bash and/or Python piping resulting data
between scripts, creating thus a seamless bioinformatics pipeline
